        <p class="u-text"> Image smoothing task is considered to be fundamental image processing task, but it's not exclusively "image" task. There exists for example<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-custom-color-2 u-btn-1" target="_blank">&nbsp;dataset smoothing&nbsp;</a>in statistics, which generalizes the concept of smoothing images to smoothing datasets. However, the task is similar –&nbsp;to capture general pattern in data.&nbsp;If we would try to formulate the task of image smoothing more precisely, we would say that we are trying to construct the new image in such way that we preserve general pattern and leave the noise and small perturbations out. How do we approach this task if we talk about digital image smoothing?

        <p class="u-text">Or it can be said the other way: what are the applications of smoothing algorithms? That's an interesting question, that is usually putted away by authors of articles. I would put it this way: edge-preserving smoothing gives the image some particular properties. What types of tasks these properties could be useful for? Algorithms can provide image abstraction (only significant objects remain) and smooth some noise, outliers and artifacts.<br>So I've tried to make a list of image smoothing applications. It is sure incomplete, but this is my view of problem. If you have some additions or simply feedback, please let me know by&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ilia.moiseev.5@yandex.ru" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-custom-color-2 u-btn-1">email</a>.

        <h3 class="u-title-2"> Image enhancement and visual effects</h3>
        <p class="u-text">
            Smoothing is extensively used for image enhancement task and for creating different visual effects. The tasks itself can vary from smoothing noise and compression artifacts to edge enhancement and detail magnification. Removing noise sounds natural for image smoothing algorithms, but they are usually not specialized in those types of tasks. This is actually could be the case, when algorithms for image smoothing wouldn't do so well on noise as it expected to, or as good as specialized noise removal algorithms. Noise removal algorithms have usually analogous principles, but they have different goals. The goal is to remove noise and preserve image as it was before the noise was added with as much detail as possible. We have a lot of specialized approaches for this type of tasks, but still can address them in some way. However, if we talk about compression artifacts, some works show&nbsp;<a href="review-of-image-smoothing-algorithms.html#carousel_3993" data-page-id="195068502" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-custom-color-2 u-btn-2">[4]</a>&nbsp;that smoothing algorithms can be successfully used for successfully removing clipart compression artifacts.

        <h3 class="u-title-2"> Image segmentation</h3>
        <p class="u-text"> Image segmentation is another example of the field where properties of smoothed images could be useful. In work&nbsp;<a href="review-of-image-smoothing-algorithms.html#carousel_3993" data-page-id="195068502" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-custom-color-2 u-btn-1">[6]</a>&nbsp;authors show the synthesis of edge-preserving smoothing and image segmentation algorithm. They use properties of the smoothed image to segment it more effectively. Their approach uses contours, but that kind of approaches are sensitive to inhomohenous structures on the image and tend to perform poorly. To address this drawback, they used total variation based smoothing approach.<br>Here we have another example of using algorithms&nbsp;to simplify image before trying to find segments on it&nbsp;<a href="review-of-image-smoothing-algorithms.html#carousel_3993" data-page-id="195068502" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-custom-color-2 u-btn-2">[7]</a>. Fernand Meyer uses special algorithm that is based on filters also called levelings. This is specialized image smoothing approach (as also in&nbsp;<a href="review-of-image-smoothing-algorithms.html#carousel_3993" data-page-id="195068502" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-custom-color-2 u-btn-3">[6]</a>) but the idea of usage is the same.

        <h2 class="u-title-2"> Different approaches</h2>
        <p class="u-text"> Approaches to image smoothing task can be divided into two distinct categories:&nbsp;explicit&nbsp;and&nbsp;implicit&nbsp;ones. I encountered this quite common and natural way of categorization first in the article&nbsp;<a href="review-of-image-smoothing-algorithms.html#carousel_3993" data-page-id="195068502" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-custom-color-2 u-btn-1">[2]</a>. It isn’t universal and widespread in the form in which I would use it, but in different reviews different authors use similar categorizations with minor deviations.So what are the explicit and implicit methods in image smoothing? Explicit methods are based around some explicit rule of calculating pixel values of new image. They are usually non-iterative and are formulated usually as weighed sum of values in pixel’s neighborhood.
        </p>
        <img class="u-image" style="width:300px;" src="../images/ql_5681bb3bc87e482edac72b16c63abfb8_l3.png" alt="">
        <p class="u-text"> Where&nbsp;p&nbsp;is certain pixel of output image&nbsp;S&nbsp;and input image&nbsp;I,&nbsp;q&nbsp;is a pixel of neighborhood&nbsp;N&nbsp;of pixel&nbsp;p&nbsp;and&nbsp;w(p,q)&nbsp;is weight of the specific filter. Weights of filter should satisfy some additional conditions. Their sum should be equal to one and in general they should be positive.Implicit methods are based on some optimization problem. I would consider algorithms that are based on deep learning as implicit too. However the majority of algorithms are usually formulated as a problem of optimization of function that looks like this:</p>
        <img class="u-image" style="width:300px;" src="../images/ql_9dfe12a63da59344671d9fe580617127_l3.png" alt="">
        <p class="u-text"> Where&nbsp;Ed&nbsp;is data term, which measures the difference between images&nbsp;I&nbsp;and&nbsp;S,&nbsp;Eν&nbsp;is smoothing term, which is responsible for making color variability smaller and&nbsp;λ&nbsp;is the coefficient for balancing this two terms.So we have different types of algorithms. Which one is better? It depends on your goals, when you are trying to smooth the image. Explicit algorithms are usually faster, or have fast implementations&nbsp;<a href="review-of-image-smoothing-algorithms.html#carousel_3993" data-page-id="195068502" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-custom-color-2 u-btn-2">[3]</a>, but implicit ones can usually provide better smoothing. However, the choice between types must be based on the goal of smoothing.<br>
          <br>Here are some examples of images smoothed by both types of algorithms:

        <p class="u-text"> We definitely should start from this filter if we talk about image smoothing in general and explicit algorithms in specific. It is fundamental and serves as a baseline for other approaches. Results of this algorithm are present in almost every new image smoothing article.<br>The idea behind it is simple and works just fine with almost all of the cases. Because we're dealing with explicit method, to define it we need to define the rule, by which its weights are computed. We can verbally formulate the rule as follows:&nbsp;the closest and the most similar pixels in the neighborhood have the biggest weights and vice versa.<br>Mathematically it would look like:

We can see that the functions of distance and intensity are the Gaussians with parameters&nbsp;σs&nbsp;and&nbsp;σr. It means that bilateral filter is based on Gaussian filter, but its weights are adaptive and take in consideration the difference in intensity values and the distance between central pixel and given pixel from neighborhood. These properties allow bilateral filter to be the baseline approach in the field of smoothing from its birth in 1998.<br>We can't start talking about bilateral filter while avoiding the topic of its computational complexity. Naive implementation of it gives unsatisfactory results - we have very&nbsp;computationally complex problem, but in the case of bilateral filter, we have a lot of improvements and approximations of it, which attest logarithmic&nbsp;<a href="review-of-image-smoothing-algorithms.html#carousel_3993" data-page-id="195068502" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-custom-color-2 u-btn-2">[10]</a>&nbsp;or even constant&nbsp;<a href="review-of-image-smoothing-algorithms.html#carousel_3993" data-page-id="195068502" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-custom-color-2 u-btn-3">[11]</a>&nbsp;complexity.<br>

It measures how in process of noise removing structure of the image wasn't damaged, but here it was used in unusual way. Resulting images of bilateral and guided filter under similar parameters were compared. PSNR showed the values between 37 and 40 db. Images are considered to be almost not recognizable, when PSNR is greater than 40db, since the difference is often visually insensitive. Let's look at the results by ourselves and try to tell the difference.<br>

In particular, this approach discriminates between two kinds of boundaries - regular and irregular ones. It is trying to preserve the first kind of boundaries, assuming that the second one represents a texture or a noise. The difference between regular and irregular boundaries and their gradient fields can be spotted on the following picture.

        <p class="u-text"> Here is regular boundary on the left. It has low deviations of gradient angles, unlike the other boundary type. It has high deviations. However, how do filter measures deviations of gradient angles in order to dicern between these types? Let's look at filter's formula to see it.<br>

        <p class="u-text"> Deviations measured as cosine of the doubled difference between angle of center pixel&nbsp;νp&nbsp;and angle of pixel in its neighborhood&nbsp;νq. When we measure angles of gradients we obtain values between&nbsp;−π/2&nbsp;and&nbsp;π/2. Doubled differences between angles of two gradients are distributed between&nbsp;−2π&nbsp;and&nbsp;2π. We need to double differences to treat angles with difference near&nbsp;π&nbsp;like similar ones, because they appear to be the parts of one boundary, as we saw on the picture with boundary types.<br>The weights are also divided by the value&nbsp;α&nbsp;that was left unmentioned.&nbsp;α&nbsp;is the gradient magnitude or simply - length. Bigger the gradient length, bigger the intesity change, smaller the weight would be. Let's finally look at the results.<br>

        <p class="u-text"> The main achievement of L0 gradient minimization approach is a method of confining the number of nonzero gradients and smoothing in global manner.

        <p class="u-text"> The last approach in this short review is Deep Filtering Network. The method is based on encoding the distinction between textures and structures in the deep neural network. Serious impediment with setting this problem as a machine learning one is adifficulty of dataset generation.&nbsp;Manual annotation of existing images is complex and time consuming, so authors generated their own dataset of images combining pure texture images with pure structure images. They have found out that cartoon images appear to be the ones that have only structures, so they have been used in generation process.<br>First, natural textures were extracted from images with only textures. Then, spatial deformation was applied to them and color was varied. Obtained textures were blended in to cartoon images.<br>Architecture of the network is builded as follows: image structure is obtained by Structure Prediction Network (SPN), similarly with texture and Texture Prediction Network (TPN). Their output becomes an input for Texture and Structure Aware Filtering Network (TSAFN). All networks are mainly based on convolutional layers. Proposed method outperforms non-learning ones in visual quality of results when compared on generated dataset.<br>But this is very specific approach by itself. It distinguishes between textures and structures by means of high-level information that was obtained as the output of neural network. It means that its results could look unusual in a way that we don't expect from smoothing algorithm. It could remove textures even if it forms strong color changes. I can illustrate this with th following picture.

        <p class="u-text"> Here we can see the results of other filters and the result of deep filtering network (the last image). Here's an example of what I posit before: network "extracted" textures from images in unusual way. It is interesting behavior and there hopefully would be more research of it.</p>

        <h2 class="u-title-2"> Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="u-text"> In this post, we described the task of image smoothing. We found out that it is fundamental low-level image processing operation, reviewed possible applications of image smoothing and several interesting methods that could be used in image processing practice.<br>Here we used the classification of methods that divides them into two categories: explicit and implicit. Explicit methods are easy to understand and compute, but they usually don't achieve the same level of smoothing as implicit methods that are in turn require more computations and more difficult to implement.<br>However, the research in this field wasn't stopped and image smoothing methods are still evolving and improving. And so we are looking forward for new algorithms in this field!
