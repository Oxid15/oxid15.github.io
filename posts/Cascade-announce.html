          it started</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">The idea of this kind of tool was in the air
          for several years since I get my first position as an intern in ML. I
          witnessed how the problems of unmanaged ML development are solved
          (tough I wasn't aware of them) on the scale of not so small company.
          What are those problems?<br>
          <br>
          Let's consider following setting. You are ML-researcher/engineer in
          the small company or (what is more common) individual. You run a lot
          of ML experiments in your Jupyter-notebook, training your models with
          different hyperparameters and data with no structure. You just quickly
          write your data pipeline and trainloop with evaluation saving the
          models and their metrics manually on disk. <br>
          <br>
          Eventually you end up with a set of binary artifacts (your ML-models)
          on disk in some arbitrarily named folders like <code>experiment228/00037/00037.pkl</code>
          etc. Suppose VCS was used to track changes in the code producing those
          models. <i>It is not always true especially in the case of small
            classical models when training may take seconds and track each
            change in the parameters by hands will be too time-consuming.</i>
          Even with the presence of code versions we cannot tell using them
          which version produced which model that is stored on disk at the end.
          Suppose we wrote all metrics needed in metadata to the same folder and
          can choose model using those metrics, but if we would want to go back
          in model versions and continue from there, we couldn't do this. <br>
          <br>
          In this setting we are condemned to fail when the number of different
          experiments becomes too large. All automatic management that can be
          done by us to prevent or postpone our failure is made by hands and
          needs to be repeated in the following similar projects. These are
          inevitable <b>metadata issues</b>. Aside from them there are also <b>reusability
            issues</b>. We have some arbitrarily written data pipeline and
          trainloop. Without any modularity or isolation in this code we cannot
          reuse it in similar projects without restructuring.<br>
          <br>
          Some of these issues in the company I worked were addressed using
          internally developed tool, which then inspired me to create my own. So
          how it started?<br>
          <br>
          It was pretty classical project - I was supposed to train a classifier
          to use it in the downstream product tasks. The dataset was not so
          large so I choosed to use classical algorithms for this task. After
          preparations I ended up with some boilerplate <code>train.py</code>
          which contained all data preparation steps and training loop where
          different classifier models were trained and evaluated. In the end
          results were compared and I was able to choose the best model, that
          was saved.<br>
          <br>
          Two problems were apparent at this stage: a) the data come from many
          different sources - the processing of different datasets has some
          different parts and some common, the code is duplicated and b) not all
          models are saved, experiments are not tracked in any way.<br>
          <br>
          At this point I decided to address these problems by creating
          utilities to use in this project - <strong>Dataset</strong> and <strong>Model</strong>
          classes. <br>
          Dataset was the wrapper around sequence of data points. It allowed me
          to simplify the code of different data pipelines. I used Dataset to
          load data from disk and applied a series of Modifiers to form a
          pipeline. Repeating stages of data processing were now incapsulated
          and could be used without repetition and different stages could easily
          be identified. <br>
          Model class was a wrapper around inference and additionally allowed me
          to define how the model is saved and loaded on disk.<br>
          <br>
          Cascade started as utils that make life easier inspired by great ideas
          that are in the air last years.</p>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1" style="margin-left: 0px;">Why
          it is used</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">There are a number of good solutions for
          problems mentioned. The main reason they were not suitable for my
          purposes it that they are designed for big companies. When you are an
          individual developer or researcher or a part of a small team, it is
          difficult to use such frameworks. The other reasons include inability
          to quickly prototype and write reusable data pipelines. <br>
          <br>
          Considering this it was obvious that some <strong>another solution
            needed</strong>. That will be suitable for small teams, more
          flexible and with the ability to use only some modules when needed.<br>
          <br>
          Cascade for me became such kind of solution for a number of projects
          at work and some research projects at university. I hope that it will
          also benefit other people experiencing similar issues and want to
          change and develop the tool in the way that will be more suitable not
          only for me.</p>

        <h2 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-1" style="margin-left: -2px; width: 310px; height: 54px;">How
          it looks now</h2>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-3"> What can you do now using
          Cascade (0.5.2)? A number of things that include:<br>
          - Build data processing pipelines using isolated reusable blocks<br>
          - Easily get and save metadata about this pipeline with little or no
          additional code<br>
          - Easily store model's artifacts and all model's metadata<br>
          - Use Web UI tools to view model's metadata and metrics to choose the
          best one<br>
          - Build data validation blocks to ensure quality of data that comes in
          the model<br>
          - Use growing library of Datasets and Models in `utils` module that
          propose some task-specific datasets (like TimeSeriesDataset) or
          framework-specific models (like SkModel)<br>
          <br>
          Now 13 releases since 0.1.0 Cascade is more mature and considered
          project. It has some ideology and <a href="https://oxid15.github.io/cascade/concepts.html">basic
            concepts</a> that are still developing of course. Since I actively
          use it in other projects it has certain responsibility as a dependency
          for them. It makes me think about legacy and how each change will
          affect old projects. This is important even though Cascade is not
          1.x.x yet. </p>

        <h2 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-1" style="margin-top: -364px; margin-left: 0px; width: 320px;">Where
          it is going</h2>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2">Cascade is only at the start of
          its way and the directions are broad and vague. I list my toughts on
          how the development will be held in the following section. However, I
          hope that with the help of community the picture can become more
          clear. So what are the directions?</p>
      </div>

        <h3 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-1" style="margin-top: -250px; margin-left: 0px; width: 486px;">Advanced
          metadata analysis</h3>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2" style="margin-top: 17px;">When
          doing ML-project with the help of Cascade many metadata files with
          parameters, metrics and dataset descriptions are written. Though they
          are human-readable, in most cases they shouldn't be read by a human.
          Cascade already have solutions for this in form of different <a href="https://oxid15.github.io/cascade/concepts.html#viewers">Viewers</a>.
          <br>
          <strong>HistoryViewer </strong>helps to see history of changes in
          Model's parameters. It automatically figures out the tree of changes
          made in the parameters and shows it to the user in respect to the
          given metric. At this moment it is in raw condition and <strong>needs
            improvement and feedback</strong>.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>MetricViewer</strong> is more broadly used tool. It helps to
          easily see metrics of models saved and choose the best one. It
          presents metrics in the form of the table either in console or as
          interactive web table with plots. Due to its intensive usage it is
          more or less debugged. Its <strong>interface will be extended</strong>
          for more fine-grained metric and parameters analysis and easy model
          selection. Additionally <strong>Web UI should become more advanced</strong>
          allowing for more interactivity.<br>
          <br>
          Another problem that is present is <strong>model files management</strong>.
          After intensive training experiments it comes time to eventually free
          disk space from redundant models. Cascade to this moment does not
          allow to manage model files. I consider this as a direction for
          further development.</p>

        <h3 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-1" style="margin-top: 28px; margin-left: 0px; width: 486px;">Pipelines</h3>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2" style="margin-top: 23px;">Pipelines
          are the second focus of Cascade. And by pipelines I mean not only data
          processing pipelines, but also <strong>model pipelines</strong>,
          which are now developing with the introduction of ModelModifier. <br>
          To build advanced pipelines with some task-specific or
          framework-specific blocks <code>cascade.utils</code> is used. Utils
          is planned to be extended to potentially become <strong>separate
            package</strong>. It also needs more extensive testing and <strong>documentation</strong>,
          which is now absent.<br>
          <strong>Data validation</strong> also needs to be further developed to
          perform automatic data drift checks or <code>NaN </code>checks for
          example.</p>

        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2" style="margin-top: 23px;">Some
          more difficult to implement ideas include <strong>code tracking</strong>
          - to dump all the code that was used to produce some model into this
          model metadata, <strong>meta loading</strong> - to load existing
          metadata of an object from disk if found and <strong>pipeline
            visualization</strong> in form of graph to easily see its structure
          and read meta of all block separately.</p>

          major version</h3>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2" style="margin-top: 23px;">Of
          course Cascade pursuits version 1.0.0 when more responsibility for
          legacy will be taken and API will be polished, tested and documented
          enough to be fixated until next major release.</p>

          publication</h3>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2" style="margin-top: 23px;">It
          doesn't mean that now you can't install Cascade using pip. You can,
          but using the <a href="https://github.com/Oxid15/cascade#installation">link
            from Github</a> which is not so elegant and convenient. I have
          attempted PyPI publication. First problem was name conflict with some
          old Github project also named cascade, so I eventually published the
          package using the name <code>cascade-ml</code>, but there was another
          problem for which I didn't found a solution. So by now it cannot be
          installed using the name, but it will be soon, when I figure out the
          issue.</p>

          was Cascade - ML engineering library and toolkit for small teams and
          individuals, developers or researchers. I am open to any discussion
          regarding the project, its architecture, features and future
          directions and hope that it would be useful not only for my specific
          tasks, but also for others! </p>
