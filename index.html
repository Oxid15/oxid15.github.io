            <p>
                <span class="emp-text">Russian</span> is my native language. I speak 
                <span class="emp-text">English</span> quite good, can understand 
                everything spoken or written in English. I've got <span class="emp-text">FCE certificate</span>
                with score 177 in December 2019, which means that I have level B2 (It is nearly C1, which is 180).
            </p>
            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
                My interests include computer vision, data science and other related topics like
                applied mathematics and statistics. The most of my
                projects and publications are in these fields. I'm also interested in art, history and politics.
                And how we can address social, political and business problems using data.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Programming experience</h3>
            <p>
                If we talk about programming languages, I know <span class="emp-text">C++</span> quite well. 
                I also know
                <span class="emp-text">C#</span> and <span class="emp-text">Python</span>.
                I've written a lot of Python code recently for computer vision tasks.
                I have experience in using numpy, OpenCV, Keras, pandas and other popular frameworks. 
                I can also write <span class="emp-text">SQL</span> queries on basic level.
                <br>
                Can't say that it's essential list of the languages that I've used in my practice,
                but these are the ones I'm most confident about.

                The paper which I've wrote with Vladimir Gudkov about new image smoothing algorithm.
                It was published in <span class="emp-text">IEEE Xplore </span>library in June 2020.
                <br>
                Image smoothing aims to get rid off small insignificant details on the image and
                to save object boundaries at the same time. It is fundamental task in image processing
                and can be useful in many fields of computer vision.
                <br>
                Here is the example of the algorithm results, original and smoothed image:

            <p>
                In my practice I had to write some image processing algorithms from scratch. Some using Python
                some using C++. So I decided to post the code to my GitHub page. Repository contains several
                algorithms such as <span class="emp-text">Hough transform</span>
                 and different variations of <span class="emp-text">image filtering</span>. It also has
                 <span class="emp-text">.bmp files handler</span> written on C++ for image files reading.
                <br>
                The result of applying Hough transform to the image with three straight lines is on the picture.

                This is hitherto my <span class="emp-text">first and biggest </span>C++ project. I was doing it initially as my course project in university,
                but then it continued to grow and became as it is now. Repository contains source code for creating and using 
                multilayer neural networks. I also started to develop evolutional algorithm that would help finding best network
                architecture. It is still under developement. I've tested networks that you could make with my code on classical
                <span class="emp-text">"XOR" problem</span> and they successfully converge on it as they should.
