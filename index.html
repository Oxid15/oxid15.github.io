                and this is my personal website! 
                I'm computer engineering student at South Ural State University right now and 
                I guess until June 2021. Here you can find detailed

            <h3>My education</h3>
            <p>
                Bachelor degree in the field of computer engineering in the 
                <a href="https://comp.susu.ru/" > Department of Electronic Computing Machines </a>
                of <a href="https://www.susu.ru/en">South Ural State University</a>  (2017-2021).
                <br>
                Mathematical logic course from The National Open University "INTUIT" (2019) | <a href="https://www.intuit.ru/verifydiplomas/101220726">Certificate</a>
                <br>
                Python programming course from stepik.org (2018) | <a href="https://stepik.org/cert/153563">Certificate</a>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h3>My languages</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="emp-text">Russian</span> is my native language. I speak 
                <span class="emp-text">English</span> quite good, can understand 
                everything spoken or written in English. Actually most of the books I'm reading now
                are in English (it is technical, mathematical and fiction literature.) I have 
                <span class="emp-text">FCE certificate</span>
                with score 177, which means that I have level B2 (I could got C1 if it would be 180). 
                I've got it after FCE exam in December 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm interested in different languages. I've studied <span class="emp-text">German</span> 
                when I was in school and
                continue to study it now by myself. I can read a little and write something simple.
            </p>
            <h3>My interests</h3>
            <p>
                My interests include computer vision, data science and other related topics like
                applied mathematics and statistics. The most of my
                projects and publications are in these fields. I'm also interested in art, history and politics.
                And how we can address social, political and business problems using data.
            </p>
            <h3>My programming experience</h3>
            <p>
                If we talk about programming languages, I know <span class="emp-text">C++</span> pretty well. 
                I cannot say that I know it on
                professional level, but I know it's low-level theory really well (like pointers and memory
                management), can use templates. I also know
                <span class="emp-text">C#</span> and <span class="emp-text">Python</span>.
                I've written a lot of Python code in the last year (2019). It was DS projects and a lot of
                CV tasks.
                You can find examples in the <a href="#projects">project list</a> below. 
                I have experience in using numpy, OpenCV, Keras, pandas and other popular frameworks.
                Now I'm trying to learn <span class="emp-text">R</span> to use it in
                my projects. 
                <br>
                Can't say that it's essential list of the languages that I've used in my practice,
                but these are the ones I'm most confident about.

                The paper which I've wrote with Vladimir Gudkov about new image smoothing algorithm.
                It was published in <span class="emp-text">IEEE Xplore </span>library in June 2020.
                <br>
                Image smoothing aims to get rid off small insignificant details on the image and
                to save object boundaries at the same time. It is fundamental task in image processing
                and can be useful in many fields of computer vision.
                <br>
                Here is the example of the algorithm results, original and smoothed image:

            <p>
                In my practice I had to write some image processing algorithms from scratch. Some using Python
                some using C++. So I decided to post the code to my GitHub page. Repository contains several
                algorithms such as <span class="emp-text">Hough transform</span>
                 and different variations of <span class="emp-text">image filtering</span>. It also has
                 <span class="emp-text">.bmp files handler</span> written on C++ for image files reading.
                <br>
                The result of applying Hough transform to the image with three straight lines is on the picture.

                This is my <span class="emp-text">first and biggest </span>C++ project by this time. I was doing it initially as my course project in university,
                but then it continued to grow and became as it is now. Repository contains source code for creating and using 
                multilayer neural networks. I also started to develop evolutional algorithm that would help finding best network
                architecture. It is still under developement. I tested networks that you could make with my code on classical
                <span class="emp-text">"XOR" problem</span> and they converge as they should.
